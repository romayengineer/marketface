# Description

This is a simple project made in python playwright and is for pulling
facebook marketplace items into a database for analysis like e.g. to
know if a product has a fair price or if it is cheep

## Plan for the project:

1. [DONE] create database to insert the url and image path
2. open each of the urls and pull title, description, price and other data
3. query the data and analyse it for decision making

## play_dynamic.py script

this is for quick development cycle as I reload this module
dynamically and I update the code to see the changing without
reloading the interpreter or the browser

once the functions in here are well developed and tested
I'll move them to the main script
